The link for git practice 
NegPod practice refers to the link: https://github.com/bakudbilla/git-practice.git

How we faced our challenges :
For the problem of branches we faced, we tackled it by restarting and doing the work together step by step making sure that everyone is understanding what is happening all throughout the way
For the internet connection we faced, we tackled it by scheduling a time to meet and work on the project somewhere there was stable connection.

Challenges we faced
We  faced the issue of intranet webterm that was stucked.
We faced another issue of some of us that merged the branches aand when another person created the new branch was seems to be the owner of that person insted of being the owner of the one who created it. 
We also have less time to at least overcome most of challenges and we took a lesson, in order to implement other assignments.
